        <p>Welcome to BoozyDev! I've long been captivated by the world of back-end development.
          While front-end has its charms, back-end has always caught had my eyes.
          Thus, BoozyDev was born: a digital playground tailored for coding sessions paired
          with a cold one. After all, around here, we make frequent use of homeBrew.
          Join me in the exploration of back-end development with a refreshing twist at BoozyDev!</p>

        <p class="option-title">Link Creator</p>
        <p>In my teenage years, I often relied on tools to generate short and memorable links.
          Recently, feeling nostalgic, I decided to try my hand at it.
          While my proficiency in nginx is a work in progress, I
          haven't quite mastered the art of managing redirections and proxies yet, resulting in somewhat lengthy links.
          Despite this, I'm proud of the outcome. Feel free to check out the results and join me on this journey of exploration!</p>

        <p class="option-title">beer-api</p>
        <p>My first encounter with back-end. I was inspired by a class discussion on REST APIs. Eager to apply what I
          had learned, I envisioned a small project: perhaps a tracker for the cold ones consumed during its creation.</p>
